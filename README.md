# The test code for Perceptron Learning Algorithm 

## Concept

The concept is to classify the data with self-improved algorithm. By adjusting the separation line function, it is possible to approach the exact line correctly classifying the labeled data.


__Potential Problem__
_The model couldn't solve non linear separable data, as the model is constructed with linear functions_

## Demonstration

In the training process, the colors of background and symbol are designed as blue for group 1 and   red for group -1. Simplified data and problem can well demonstrate the algorithm.

The figure shows an example of non linear separable data, where some points in -1 group are located inside the range of 1 group.
